an app that learns with you and not for you and helps you understand the topics you are learning

this app leverages the use of OCR (Computer vision) to find text regions and then also leverages local AI Models with the uploaded files to teach and get you to understand topics that you may not understand in class with a teacher. this is done all through the power of trail and error and an algorithim that is constently trying to figure out your level of understanding as well what you don't understand.
